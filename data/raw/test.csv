"""I started Ortho Tri-Cyclin Lo when I turned 18; used it for about 3 years until my cycles started showing up whenever they wanted. My doctor switched me to Sprintec, which was a constant dose of hormone as opposed to the increasing dose like OTCL. Sprintec turned me into an absolutely CRAZY person; my emotions were out of control and my doc seemed to think there was no problem at all. I took myself off of the meds for about 6 months trying to rebalance my system and found a new doctor. My new doctor diagnosed me with PCOS and suggested Lo Loestrin Fe. She told me there was a good chance that my period would go away entirely and asked if I was ok with that. BEST DECISION I EVER MADE! Spotted ONCE since starting it in Nov 2014--no more cycle!""",1

Now my migraines have reduced (which is awesome), but I have horrible pain in my arms and hands that I&#039;ve never experienced before. My forearm muscles won&#039;t flex, so somehow the toxin spread rather far away. My mouth is extremely dry as well and I have difficulty swallowing. The pain in my arms is unbearable at times. I do not recommend Botox at all, despite the reduction in migraines. I will never get this again.

Pros:  Effective in preventing pregnancy, normal periods lasted 4-5 days once every 3 months.
Cons:  Severe moodiness and impatience in first 1 1/2 months which turned to moderate depression for remaining months and overall general unhappiness.
Increased appetite which led to increase weight gain in the belly (5-7 lbs in 6 months).
Extreme bloating in belly area in the 2nd &amp; 3rd month in each cycle.
Mild monthly cramping during times when period normally comes. 
Bone &amp; muscle pain - mostly in knees &amp; legs &amp; teeth.

This lutera, each time I used it, puffed, &amp; bloated me up SO much, that I swear it&#039;s NOT the same ingredients as Alesse. It felt like a totally different god awful pill. It felt like I perpetually, was in PMS mode; bloated to a highly uncomfortable level! Something is amiss with this pill. Whether it even has levenorgestrel in it, is debatable.

The side effect that causes them to take me off of it was because it was making me manic (as I am bipolar) and it caused me to make quick, risky, and ill-advised life decisions.

Taking me off the drug has effectively stopped the quick life decision side effect, and after getting off of it, I&#039;ve been able to think more clearly, be more mindful of my movement and thought-processes, and gave me a general feeling of wellness.

Little things like small talk and excessive noises triggered my symptoms and I was put on Ritalin LA when I was eight. Ritalin was awful for me. I didn&#039;t sleep very well at all. I had periods of insomnia and when I would sleep it was very prolonged in hours of sleep I was getting. Finally, after a couple of years suffering with this Ritalin I talked with my doctor about trying a new medicine called Focalin XR when I was 13 and I am almost 18 now.

Introduced to Opana, they worked 10x better without having the euphoric feeling (major for me). Due to cost, I switched from Opana ER 2x40mg. per day to the generic oxymorphone 3x30mg. per day. Although generic does not last as long as the Opana brand, taking 3 X per day (every 8 hours) works very well. Rarely do I have the level of pain I used to while taking other medicines.

It worked great for me, but some people had problems with that dose of 1 mg and the FDA said doctors could not write anything above .50, or two white caps, .25.  When I had to reduce my dose, it took me 6 months to get my body adjusted.  So, 31 years later, I am 59 now and have to have the .50 to sleep.

Don&#039;t drink too much right before dosing so that you can get all the solution/water down comfortably. Do drink as much fluid as you can in between doses to stay hydrated. And RELAX!

How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm.

I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling.

If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour.

I am a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar average in the past 10 days has been 110. I have a CGM so I have had 2880 readings in the past 10 days.  A 110 average equals to an A1C of 5.45. This is possible because Afrezza mimics the speed of a healthy pancreas. Afrezza starts working in only 12-15 minutes and works out of my system very quickly.

Methadone is NOT a treatment of substance abuse, but a tool to aid in the treatment of substance abuse. It does not cure withdrawal, it stops withdrawal symptoms when at a therapeutic level. You will experience withdrawal symptoms when methadone is tapered or discontinued. Those using methadone for substance abuse tend to treat methadone in similar ways as a street drug.

I will say if you cheat on your diet do not take Alli you will have oil movements instead of a normal bowel motion. However, even in my instance Alli caused me serious stomach issues. Although I did not have accidents I did have feelings that I was not going to make it to the restroom or extreme gas. This pill all depends on your body chemistry.

Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug.

Again I bleed so much I think it&#039;s something wrong this is a no go for me... true you won&#039;t get pregnant, but the side effects make you not want to do the things to get you pregnant!!!""",0
"""I take 300 mg 3x a day and I feel the best I&#039;ve felt in 10 years. Nothing has worked to calm my anxiety like Gabapentin including Klonopin or Xanax. I&#039;m happy, relaxed, motivated and most importantly my appetite for alcohol which I used excessively to calm my anxiety has completely disappeared. I hope I can take this medication for forever. Life is finally good again.""",1
"""Stay away from sharp objects!! 2 months on 37.5MG Effexor - feels like my attention is limited to a single train of thought. I can&#039;t do more than one thing at once without risking personal injury. Clumsily shredded myself bloody more than ever in my life while on this med. Doors and fridge cut my feet open because I literally cannot pay attention to the fridge door if I&#039;m looking at the contents of fridge or don&#039;t see screen door closing on me while carrying something in from outside. Haven&#039;t been cooking much but the one time I tried I burned green beans in the pan. It makes me sleep 16h/day. If I get up before 2pm I can&#039;t trust myself to drive. 2 close calls were enough. Social anxiety is worse than before. Only 37.5 MG!! Need a change""",0
"""I am 18 and have been on Depo since I was 15 due to severe menstrual bleeding. When I first got the shot I noticed my bleeding kept lightening up until my second shot and it stopped all together. I eat like a pig, but that&#039;s not really a big deal for me. During the first 4-5 months I lost 40 pounds, and slightly over a year later I&#039;ve gained 20 back. I know a lot of girls fidget and carry on over the weight issue, but if you exercise daily and eat appropriately, it won&#039;t turn into a big deal. I definitely recommend this to my friends who either have bleeding issues or just don&#039;t want to get pregnant. Works PERFECTLY in both cases; at least for me!""",1
"""I was diagnosed with Stage IV Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) in April 2009, and told by my primary care physician that my prognosis was approximately 6-9 months, perhaps a year. I found an oncologist that specialized in RCC and was told that this was the only course of action that had the potential to cure, not just stall the progression of my cancer. After 3 courses, I have had a complete response - no detectable cancer for 6 months so far.""",1
"""After years of chronic pain and depression that responded to nothing I finally asked for a Vitamin D blood test. BINGO. Low normal is 40 - I was a 4. After 8 weeks of once a week doses of 50,000 units, and a daily dose of 2000 units, I am feeling better than I have in years! I live in AZ - low D can happen anywhere!""",1
"""I have had three episodes of Diverticulitus in the last five years.  Because I had pretty rough experiences with Flagyl / Cipro combination in my previous episodes, I asked for the pharmacist to advise me, with my prior history in mind. I really wanted this time to be different. He said the most important advice is DO NOT USE ALCOHOL, which sounds like common sense; but that includes mouthwash. (you might swallow a bit)  It&#039;s a slow recovery; absolutely. I live in So Cal and this was during a heat wave, but I slept day and night the first few days with a heating pad on my lower adbomen. The pharmacy confirmed Tylenol is okay pain, also.  It&#039;s not a walk in the park, but I did better this time, even with other minor side effects.""",1
"""For me, it was not quite as good as Restoril and Dalmane, but it is right up there.""",1
"""Diagnosed with Fibromyalgia several months ago, probably have had the symptoms for more than a year.  Cymbalta made me a zombie, Pristiq has been an answer to prayer.  I am pretty much pain free, unless I exert myself or sometimes just have a bad day.  But, the good days far outweigh the bad.  Still nap occasionally, still have insomnia occasionally, but am totally happy with the way I feel.""",1
"""I&#039;ve been on this birth control for about 3 years and it has been great. It does the job. I thought iId write this review because I didn&#039;t see many write ups about the generic version (MyLan) and I have been on both the brand name (Generess) for about 2 years or so and then switched to the generic for price purposes and have been on that for at least a year. I started Generess when I was in highschool because I had really uncomfortable heavy 7 day periods and was also in a long term relationship. I am now in college and when I switched to the generic version I had no change in side effects or periods. I very rarely get a period (5&#039;4, 115 pounds) and had no weight gain that I can attribute to the pill. My skin is clear and never got pregnant""",1
"""Had done this  process  3 timesbefore, 1st time use Prepopkit. Co-pay is $125 since insurance won&#039;t cover this. Followed instruction exactly and no effect ion.  No BM after 1st dose, has three after 2nd dose. I have one hour left and still not clean. Sucks.""",0
"""I have eczema, which is a form of dermatitis.  I get it most predominantly in the fall through the spring on different parts of my body.  I take an antihistamine for the itching sensation and use pramosone for the dry, cracked, painful physical reaction.  It has saved my life (and my mind) more than a few times; however, once it expires it doesn&#039;t have the same amazing effect.""",1
"""Very helpful in falling and staying asleep.""",1
"""Started Nexplanon 2 months ago because I have a minimal amount of contraception&#039;s I can take due to my inability to take the hormone that is used in most birth controls. I&#039;m trying to give it time because it is one of my only options right now. But honestly if I had options I&#039;d get it removed.
I&#039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&#039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&#039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex? Very unhappy and hope that I get it back with time or I&#039;m getting it removed.""",0
"""I love Tri-sprintec! It has regulated my cycle and cleared up my skin. The first couple of months I was a little nauseated when I took it, but that has gone away. This pill helped to balance out my hormones and actually helped me to lose weight. No complaints other than the 1-2 nights of nausea I experience when I start a new pack. Oh, and it&#039;s FREE.

"""I&#039;m on 40mg a day, did take sertraline, mirtazapine now on these, don&#039;t think they do anything to me, doctor says he don&#039;t know if I got bi polar or schizophrenia lol, that&#039;s what u get for being honest. did stop them once for week as thought doing nothing, never felt so ill in my life if that&#039;s a cold turkey. I&#039;m 35 anyone else on 40mg? """,0
"""I had unprotected sex and he ejaculated completely inside me. About 38 hours later, I took the pill with food and water. I was expecting my period about a week from that day. Throughout the whole time waiting for my period I had absolutely zero side affects, and it really really worried me. It was about 2 weeks after I took it that I finally got my period, and I was never so happy to be in so much pain.""",1
"""1/10/2017 I was ovulating. The sexual relations occurred that day. Plan b was taken 1/11/2017 around 6pm. On 1/21/2017 I got a positive pregnancy test. Plan b was not effective for me when taken during ovulation. If you are ovulating or near ovulation it is best to reframe from sex, get on birth control, use condoms, or any other birth control measure that would result in not getting pregnant. Placing your future in the hands of a pharmaceutical product is absolutely silly.""",0
"""For the people who are worried about taking Tamiflu because of vomiting or worse symptoms, there is no need. I was worried of vomiting when my doctor prescribed it too me. To lessen the chance or basically exterminate the chance of vomiting, have a snack or a meal and you won&#039;t feel a thing. It will feel like your taking a regular medicine.""",1
"""I only used Nuvaring for 8 days. I didn&#039;t have cramping or anything but in the first 5 days I gained 5 lbs despite exercising 5 days per week.  I also started salivating a lot more (on the verge of drooling), had a much increased appetite, was nauseous, and on the day I decided to remove it, I was very dizzy for most of the day, nauseous, and had a headache. I think I&#039;ll be going with a copper IUD.""",0
"""I&#039;ve been taking this for nearly a year now, and I can honestly say I&#039;ve been heartburn-free since the day after I started taking it. I can eat all the things that I love but used to keep me up all night (tomato sauce, bananas and peanut butter were the worst). 
It is quite expensive, about a $1 a pill with insurance, but worth every penny. It&#039;s can also be a hassle because I have to wait to eat in the morning after I take it, but I am able to get something at work.
I took Tagamet for a while, then Zantac (75 and then 150), and both those stopped working after a few months. Tums, Rolaids and all the other chewables, and liquids like Mylanta all quit working years ago. My doctor decided to step it up and prescribe this to me and my life changed.""",1
"""I had lost interest in most areas of my life, lived in a constant state of anxiety and fear, and had become underweight.  I struggled to get the right dosage of Celexa, took about 2 months to get it right. But now, almost a year later, I am a different person.  I have started having fun again, almost nothing sets me into panic mode, and have become a healthy weight again since I regained my appetite.""",1
"""Helped greatly with pain, confusion and saying words I was thinking. Went from about 4-5 hours of sleep a night to 12-14 hours solid sleep for first month. (It felt GREAT to sleep without waking from pain. First time in 8-9 years!) Now only have an occasional late night here and there and sleep as much or little as I want. I do have muscle tightness and  twitching when I lay down at night. Stretching and heated muscle rubs help. """,1
